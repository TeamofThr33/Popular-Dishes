We had a 5 o clock reservation for a table near the window and were seated right away. The view was stunning. We started with the crab tator tots that our server recommended and they were delicious. For dinner I had the ahí tuna and my husband had the mixed grill blackened with crab, we both loved our food. Our sons both had the kids salmon and they left their plates spotless. Our server was very attentive and helpful with our boys (10 and 13). If you plan on having a nice meal, it pays to make a reservation, we made one for a window table at sunset and we were not disappointed.","userReviewDate":"11/28/2015","userReviewRating":3,"userFriendsCount":292,"userReviewsCount":178},{"username":"Tina D.","usernamePhotoURL":"https://foodimages123456.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/UserProfiles/UserProfile2.jpg","userReview":"We plan to have a nice a meal on every trip we take and we chose Fog Harbor for our San Francisco trip based on their stellar reviews.

Too bad that we didn't discover this place until our last night. The staff were kind and attentive. Our water glasses never went below half full. The food was AMAZING. DO NOT skip the calamari app--yum! It was so fresh and the fried jalapeños and the lemon aioli made it second only to the clam chowder. The table enjoyed the mixed grill meal and the scallop and crab risotto. Both highly recommended! You can see the water--and Alcatraz--from almost every seat. Jeremy made my night with a Happy Birthday treat! He was also very knowledgeable about the menu and provided us with a memorable experience. Will definitely return on our next trip!

View was ok. Food was somewhat average for typical tourist restaurant. My experience was totally ruined when the bill came out. We set down and ordered platter for two for $ 79.00. We were thinking that the portion was on the heavy side. Service was below average considering waiter wasn't paying much attention. After the meal our waiter, Michael Kelly, gave us a bill worth $ 145.00. When I asked our waiter about the price, he told me that we ordered with lobster tail. And he said that it was a mistake. Presenting $ 79 menu and giving $ 145 bill sounds like a typical scam.

I loved the waiting area which looked like a living room. They had a giant fireplace and very cozy couches. Our host took us to our booth which was right in front of the big windows overlooking the bay. He was extremely friendly and very funny as well. We actually asked him for some recommendations which he recommended the clam chowder (of course) and the shellfish platter. Not long after our waitress came by and took our drink orders. We ordered a couple of waters and two oyster shots. We got the fried calamari as starters, we got two bottles of clam chowder, and the shellfish platter. Before we knew it everything started coming out. The oyster shots were delicious. The clam chowders were amazing. Best I've had in a while. It wasn't too fishy and the clams and the potatoes inside were very tender and tasty. Loved it. The shellfish platter was insanely delicious. The buttery sauce was so amazing. We couldn't get enough. We dipped the extra bread in the butter sauce and it was delicious. The fried calamari who is very crispy which is how it should be and very well seasoned. And when our waitress brought out the check she brought two pieces of Biscoff cookies with it.

I had the scallops and crab risotto special and my wife had the seafood combo - both cooked and seasoned perfectly. I would make this restaurant a regular stop if I lived here.","userReviewDate":"5/22/2012","userReviewRating":4,"userFriendsCount":371,"userReviewsCount":38},{"username":"Katie S.","usernamePhotoURL":"https://foodimages123456.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/UserProfiles/UserProfile2.jpg","userReview":"Best clam chowder with crab!

We had a 5 o clock reservation for a table near the window and were seated right away. The view was stunning. We started with the crab tator tots that our server recommended and they were delicious. For dinner I had the ahí tuna and my husband had the mixed grill blackened with crab, we both loved our food. Our sons both had the kids salmon and they left their plates spotless. Our server was very attentive and helpful with our boys (10 and 13).

View was ok. Food was somewhat average for typical tourist restaurant. My experience was totally ruined when the bill came out. We set down and ordered platter for two for $ 79.00. We were thinking that the portion was on the heavy side. Service was below average considering waiter wasn't paying much attention. After the meal our waiter, Michael Kelly, gave us a bill worth $ 145.00. When I asked our waiter about the price, he told me that we ordered with lobster tail. And he said that it was a mistake. Presenting $ 79 menu and giving $ 145 bill sounds like a typical scam. Hope others will share the same experience soon.","userReviewDate":"7/11/2019","userReviewRating":2,"userFriendsCount":173,"userReviewsCount":111}]}],"_id":"5e351b07fa34e57c6620cab6","__v":0}
