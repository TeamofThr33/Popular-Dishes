For dinner I had the ahÃ­ tuna and my husband had the mixed grill blackened with crab, we both loved our food. Our sons both had the kids salmon and they left their plates spotless. Our server was very attentive and helpful with our boys (10 and 13). If you plan on having a nice meal, it pays to make a reservation, we made one for a window table at sunset and we were not disappointed.');
